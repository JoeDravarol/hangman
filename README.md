# Hangman Game (Command line Version)

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player think of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))

In this project, I will be applying what I'd learnt so far on File I/O & Serialization:

* Reading data from a text file which contains a dictionary of words
* Writing data to save game
* Reading data to load game
